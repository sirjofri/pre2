I will set up the readme later.

to make it short and simple:

pre2 ("prez") is a little presentation program for images. it fully works in browser without any kind of server. it depends on html5. it is tested with chromium on opensuse 11.2. today it is a german program (i am german) but tomorrow there may be an english release, too.
